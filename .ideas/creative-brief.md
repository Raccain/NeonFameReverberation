# MyReverb — Creative Brief

## Hook
*The elastic soul of spring reverb, tuned for the deep house groove.*

## Concept
MyReverb is a spring reverb plugin built specifically for the demands of deep house production. It captures the bouncy, organic character of real spring tanks — the sizzle, the wobble, the bloom — while giving producers the precision controls needed to sit a reverb perfectly in a mix.

Where most spring reverb emulations chase vintage lo-fi, MyReverb threads a different needle: warm and characterful, but controlled. Clean enough for pads and chords, elastic enough for percussion and bass hits. The kind of reverb that adds movement without muddying a groove.

## Sonic Character
- **Foundation:** Classic spring reverb with realistic allpass-based tank simulation
- **Tension:** A spring's defining trait — the metallic resonance and "boing" that makes springs distinctive
- **Modulation (Wobble):** Subtle chorus-like pitch drift that gives life to long tails, essential for deep house atmosphere
- **Drive:** Light tube-style saturation before the spring input — warms up the feed and adds harmonic density
- **Damping:** Controls how fast high frequencies decay, dialing in anything from a bright sizzle to a dark, muffled wash

## Target Use Cases
- Snare and clap reverb trails in deep house drums
- Chord and piano stab ambience
- Bass note bloom and sustain
- Vocal texture layering
- Atmospheric pad diffusion

## Visual Aesthetic
**Dark & Minimal.** Black panel. Subtle white labels. Clean knobs with minimal chrome. No skeuomorphic decoration — the controls speak for themselves. Feels like a serious studio tool, not a toy.
